it seems bad there's no call to `o` and we are using `fgets` so no overflow is possible, and even if possible we can not do it because we are exiting before we reach `ret` instruction,

[system instead of exit](../explained/plt_got.md)

well now you can see that we can do some tricks maybe if we filled that table with fake addresses like maybe the address of exit start to point to system directly!

yeah we could try it but how are you going to pass the parameters to `system` like `/bin/sh`, well
I'll try to not jump directly to `system` but to the function `o` instead

well now we have the big idea, let's see the memory

now `fgets`, will start storing our input from the memory address `0xbffff510`

![](./Ressources/pics/16.png)

so what we need now is somehow use printf to fill the address!!! of exit, in that table that we saw
before, so what location should we fill? with what value?

![](./Ressources/pics/17.png)

with what value? well that is easy just the location of the function `o`
what location should we fill? that's a bit harder, let's see

![](./Ressources/pics/18.png)

not let's step inside that `exit@plt`

![](./Ressources/pics/19.png)

what is going in this instruction, it will fetch what is stored in `0x8049838`, and jump to it, so
what we need to do is to put the location of `o` in the address `0x8049838` at this point it's easy
it's like level4 now

```sh
python -c "from __future__ import print_function; print('\x38\x98\x04\x08' + '%134513824d%4\$n')"
```
134513824 = 0x8049838 - 0x4

why `%4` well because I want printf to use the 4th argument
